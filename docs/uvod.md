## **1.3 Target audience**

This document is intended primarily for the development team to have an insight into how it went
project development. Also, the intended audience for this document is requirements engineers, managers
projects and users in order to better understand the purpose and way of using the application.

## **1.4 Product Scope**

bbKuponi is designed as a platform in the form of a web application for publishing and advertising coupons.
This software system enables the marketing and sales departments of various companies to carry out
publication of coupons in order to improve sales, and analysis of their products with the help of the number of likes
and comments on individual coupons.

The benefits of this system are reflected in the following aspects:

- faster response to increase/decrease in demand for certain services and products

- reduction of advertising costs through:
  
     
- replacement of physical copies with digital ones
  
     -reducing the number of personnel for the distribution of coupons
  
- environmental benefits

On the other hand, end customers are provided with a very simple overview of available coupons. The ultimate
customers can easily get their copy of the coupon, without the need to register, which will continue
redeem for a specific service or product.
If the end user registers on the mentioned system, he will be given options such as:
posting coupons, liking, commenting, etc.

The mentioned system will not distribute coupons through ads, emails, newsletters and the like
ways, because the mentioned system is designed as an open platform for advertising. Also, a system that
we will describe below does not provide opportunities such as:

- automatic generation of unique coupons, because users do not have to register
to get your copy of it
- monitoring resource consumption, through the metric of how many visitors have downloaded a certain coupon.
